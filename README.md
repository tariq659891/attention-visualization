# Attention Visualization

A powerful tool for creating educational animations about attention mechanisms in transformer models.

## Overview

This project provides a framework for creating high-quality animations to explain complex concepts in machine learning, specifically focused on attention mechanisms in transformer models. The current implementation includes:

1. **Multi-Head Attention Animation**: A detailed visual explanation of how attention works in transformer models
2. **Audio Narration**: Automatic generation of synchronized narration using text-to-speech
3. **Subtitle Generation**: Automatic subtitle creation aligned with the narration

## Features

- **Beautiful Manim Animations**: Leverages the Manim animation library to create professional-quality visualizations
- **Automatic Audio Generation**: Text-to-speech integration for narration
- **Synchronized Subtitles**: Perfectly timed subtitles that match the animation and narration
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend to create animations for other ML concepts

## Example Output

The current implementation produces a ~2:20 minute video explaining Multi-Head Attention with:
- Step-by-step visual explanation of token embeddings, Q/K/V vectors, and attention computation
- Clear narration explaining each concept
- Synchronized subtitles for better comprehension
- Explanation of Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) as an optimization technique

## Future Development

I'm considering developing this into a full product where you could:
- **Drag and drop** to create custom animations
- **Automatic generation** of animations from concept descriptions
- **Customizable templates** for different ML concepts
- **Export options** for various formats and platforms

## Interested in a Custom Solution?

If you're interested in having me develop a custom animation tool for your educational or business needs, I'd love to hear from you! I can create:

1. A web-based tool where you can input concepts and automatically generate animations
2. A desktop application for creating and editing ML concept animations
3. Custom animations for your specific use case

### How to Get Started

To collaborate on this project or request custom development:

1. **Contact me**: Open an issue on this repository or reach out via email
2. **Share your requirements**: Let me know what concepts you'd like to visualize
3. **Access**: I'll need GitHub access to create a repository for your custom solution
